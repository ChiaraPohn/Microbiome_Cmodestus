# Microbiome_Cmodestus
Investigating bacteriome and virome of early lab colony Culex modestus mosquitoes

This is a workflow including HPC analyses of Illumina sequencing reads for viral metagenomics (ViPER pipeline), 16S bacteriome analyses in R using the DADA2 pipeline, and follow-up statistical analyses in R. All R scripts are numbered according to the order I used them in their respective project. 

#### VIROME

ViPER Pipeline () for processing Illumina reads - this includes deduplexing, assembly, ....



#### BACTERIOME

1: 16S metabarcoding sequences processed via the DADA2 pipeline () 
2:
